Repository: variables and loops in C

    These C programs make use of variables, loops, and functions: putchar(), printf(), puts() etc.



0-positive_or_negative.c
 The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

 The output of the program should be:
 The number n, followed by
  if the number is greater than 0: "is positive"
  if the number is 0: "is zero"
  if the number is less than 0: is negative
   followed by a new line (\n)



1-last_digit.c
 The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

 The output of the program should be:
 The string "Last digit of," followed by n, followed by the string "is," followed by
  if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
  if the last digit of n is 0: the string "and is 0"
  if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
  followed by a new line



2-print_alphabet.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then a new line.

 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar twice in your code.



3-print_alphabets.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar three times in your code.



4-print_alphabt.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

 Print all the letters except q and e
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar twice in your code.



5-print_numbers.c
 The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

 All code should be in the main function



6-print_numberz.c
 The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

 Not allowed to use any variable of type char
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 Only use putchar twice in your code
 All code should be in the main function



7-print_tebahpla.c
 The program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar twice in your code



8-print_base16.c
 program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

 only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 only use putchar three times in your code



9-print_comb.c
 The program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

 Numbers must be separated by ",", followed by a space
 Numbers should be printed in ascending order
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar four times maximum in your code
 No use of variable of type char.



100-print_comb3.c
 The program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

 Numbers must be separated by ",", followed by a space
 The two digits must be different
 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
 Print only the smallest combination of two digits
 Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 Only use putchar five times maximum in your code

 All code should be in the main function



101-print_comb4.c
 The program prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

 Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
 The three digits must be different
 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2

 Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 Only use putchar six times maximum in your code
 No use of any variable of type char
 All code should be in the main function



102-print_comb5.c
The program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

 The numbers should range from 0 to 99
 The two numbers should be separated by a space
