Repository: variables and loops in C

    These C programs make use of variables, loops, and functions: putchar(), printf(), puts() etc.


0-positive_or_negative.c
 The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

 The output of the program should be:
 The number n, followed by
  if the number is greater than 0: "is positive"
  if the number is 0: "is zero"
  if the number is less than 0: is negative
   followed by a new line (\n)


1-last_digit.c
 The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

 The output of the program should be:
 The string "Last digit of," followed by n, followed by the string "is," followed by
  if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string "and is greater than 5"
  if the last digit of n is 0: the string "and is 0"
  if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string "and is less than 6 and not 0"
  followed by a new line


2-print_alphabet.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then a new line.

 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar twice in your code.


3-print_alphabets.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar three times in your code.


4-print_alphabt.c
 The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

 Print all the letters except q and e
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 All code should be in the main function
 Only use putchar twice in your code.


5-print_numbers.c
 The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

 All code should be in the main function


6-print_numberz.c
 The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

 Not allowed to use any variable of type char
 Only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
 Only use putchar twice in your code
 All code should be in the main function
